Where I have intercepted these I have pointed the enquirer towards the membership section on our club website. I am not aware of how many of these enquiries have led to new club membership but I am aware of a few that have certainly printed-off a copy of the application form so hopefully we have picked up some new members as a result of them first finding-out about us through Facebook. One thing is certain though, if people are asking about spares availability there are obviously more cars out there ‘sleeping’ than we are aware of which is a cheerful thought."

The fact that our Facebook page is attracting a decent engagement is extremely positive and that interest should only grow. Hopefully more TMC members will start to use this platform as it provides a great additional forum for us all to share both personal experiences of owning these cars as well as sharing tips on how to keep them in fine fettle so that they last for many more years and come to the attention of a younger generation who may go on to be future custodians of these lovely little cars.”"

It was more than sufficient for creating the new website in the form it’s currently in, but it became obvious after v1.1 released that it wasn’t going to cut the mustard for the kind of advanced functionality we have planned to take the website to the next level…"
