# Triumph Mayflower Club Website (Next.js Rewrite)

This is the v2.0 rewrite of [TriumphMayflowerClub.com](https://www.triumphmayflowerclub.com/), built using [Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org/) (built on top of [React](https://www.reactjs.org/)), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Sass](https://www.sass-lang.com/). When this SPA reaches parity with the current [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com/)-based website, we will switch over to using this one. The objective is to enable the addition of more advanced features that are currently impossible (or at least impractical to implement) with a static website.

Forked from [Stack-in-a-box/triumphmayflowerclub.com](https://www.github.com/Stack-in-a-box/triumphmayflowerclub.com).

## Development guidelines

### Prerequisites

1. Install Node (and npm via the Node installer) from: https://www.nodejs.org/
2. Install all npm dependencies by running: `npm install`

### Running the app

1. Run the development server by running: `npm run dev`
2. Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to see the app running.
3. Make your code changes and save them. The development server will watch the filesystem for changes, then automatically rebuild the app and refresh your browser to reflect your changes near-instantly.

### Run tests

To run [Jest](https://www.jestjs.io/)â€™s built-in, interactive test watcher, use the command: `npm test`
